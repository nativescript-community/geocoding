## Demos and Development


### Repo Setup

The repo uses submodules. If you did not clone with ` --recursive` then you need to call
```
git submodule update --init
```

The package manager used to install and link dependencies must be `pnpm` or `yarn`. `npm` wont work.

To develop and test:
if you use `yarn` then run `yarn`
if you use `pnpm` then run `pnpm i`

**Interactive Menu:**

To start the interactive menu, run `npm start` (or `yarn start` or `pnpm start`). This will list all of the commonly used scripts.

### Build

```bash
npm run build.all
```
WARNING: it seems `yarn build.all` wont always work (not finding binaries in `node_modules/.bin`) which is why the doc explicitly uses `npm run`

### Demos

```bash
npm run demo.[ng|react|svelte|vue].[ios|android]

npm run demo.svelte.ios # Example
```

Demo setup is a bit special in the sense that if you want to modify/add demos you dont work directly in `demo-[ng|react|svelte|vue]`
Instead you work in `demo-snippets/[ng|react|svelte|vue]`
You can start from the `install.ts` of each flavor to see how to register new demos

## Contributing

### Update repo 

You can update the repo files quite easily

First update the submodules

```bash
npm run update
```

Then commit the changes
Then update common files

```bash
npm run sync
```
Then you can run `yarn|pnpm`, commit changed files if any

### Update readme 
```bash
npm run readme
```

### Update doc 
```bash
npm run doc
```

### Publish

The publishing is completely handled by `lerna` (you can add `-- --bump major` to force a major release)
Simply run 
```shell
npm run publish
```

### modifying submodules

The repo uses https:// for submodules which means you won't be able to push directly into the submodules.
One easy solution is t modify `~/.gitconfig` and add
```
[url "ssh://git@github.com/"]
	pushInsteadOf = https://github.com/
```
